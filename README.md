# project-Mathland
REACT ON RAILS application for encouraging children to practice arithmetic.

### Outline
This application was put together with a React front end on Rails to with a PostgreSQL database. This application was initially intended to be focused on getting teh attention of chilren, who could create their own characters and insert themselves into a story they could directly influence. Due to time constraints and functional practicalty, the focus was then turned towards adding a more direct benefit. Introducing an academic component (more specifcally mathematics) allowed for direct placements of achievable tasks for users to get response from. In it's current iteration, Mathland acts more as a basic arithmetic math tudor than it's initial intent of story writing for children.

#### Goals and Improvements


### Planning
Having gone into this project with a working foundation of using MongoDB with mongoose and express, getting the application foundations set up proved straightforward and relatively seemless. Bringing in the React front-end then quickly fell into place. Beyond setups, the greatest planning obstacles were deciding ultimately what features to tackle. Between a 3rd party API and an interactive compositon feature, the compositon seemed the most direct adn immediate goal and was tehrefore pursued. At that phase of planning, the model was clear in mind, but the nature of its implementation was still hazy as evident in the ERD and wire-frames. In future projects, pursuing diverse options for post MVP wire-frames may prove more benefitial to workflow to avoid the hangups of making a clear picture out of a hazy goal.
